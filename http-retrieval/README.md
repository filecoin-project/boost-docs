# HTTP Retrieval

Boost introduced a new binary, `booster-http`, with release v1.2.0. This binary can be run alongside the `boostd` market process in order to serve retrievals over http.

Currently, there is no payment method or built-in security integrated in the new binary. It can be run with any stable release of `boostd` and can also be run on a separate machine from the `boostd` process.

Release v1.7.0-rc1 introduced support in `booster-http` for running an [IPFS gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview), which enables Storage Providers to serve content to their users in multiple formats as described below and demonstrated using `curl`.

### Retrieving a full Piece
When performing certain actions, such as replicating deals, it can be convenient to retrieve the entire Piece (with padding) to ensure commp integrity.

```
curl http://{SP's http retrieval URL}/piece/bagaSomePieceCID -o bagaSomePieceCID.piece
```

### Retrieving a CAR file
To return the CAR file for a given CID, you can pass an `Accept` header with the `application/vnd.ipld.car;` format. This can be useful for retrieving the raw, unpadded data of a deal.

```
curl -H "Accept:application/vnd.ipld.car;" http://{SP's http retrieval URL}/ipfs/bagaSomePayloadCID -o bagaSomePayloadCID.car
```

### Retrieving specific files
For Storage Providers that have enabled serving raw files (disabled by default), users can retrieve specific files, such as images by their cid and path where applicable. See [Enable serving files](https://boost.filecoin.io/http-retrieval/serving-files-with-booster-http#enable-serving-files) for a more in depth example.

```
curl http://{SP's http retrieval URL}/ipfs/{content ID}/{optional path to resource} -o myimage.png
```

### Retrieving IPLD blocks
For advanced IPFS and IPLD use cases, you can now retrieve individual blocks by passing an `Accept` header with the `application/vnd.ipld.raw;` format

```
curl -H "Accept:application/vnd.ipld.car;" http://{SP's http retrieval URL}/ipfs/bagaSomeBlockCID -o bagaSomeBlockCID
```

## Local Setup

SPs should try a local setup and test their HTTP retrievals before proceeding to run `booster-http` in production.

To build and run `booster-http` :

1. Clone the boost repo and checkout the latest release

```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost.git
cd boost
git checkout <release>
```

2. Build the new binary

```
make booster-http
```

3. Collect the token information for boost, lotus-miner and lotus daemon API

```
export ENV_BOOST_API_INFO=`boostd auth api-info --perm=admin`
export BOOST_API_INFO=echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'
```

```
export ENV_FULLNODE_API_INFO=`lotus auth api-info --perm=admin`
export FULLNODE_API_INFO=echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'
```

```
export ENV_MINER_API_INFO=`lotus-miner auth api-info --perm=admin`
export MINER_API_INFO=echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'
```

4. Start the `booster-http` server with the above details

```
booster-http run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO --api-fullnode=$FULLNODE_API_INFO --api-storage=$MINER_API_INFO
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can run multiple `booster-http` processes on the same machine by using a different port for each instance with the `--port` flag. You can also run multiple instances of the `booster-http` on different machines.
{% endhint %}

## Running Public Boost HTTP Retrieval

The booster-http server listens on localhost. To expose the server publically, SPs should run a reverse proxy such as [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) to handle operational concerns like:

* SSL
* Authentication
* Load balancing

While booster-http may get more operational features over time, the intent is that providers who want to scale their HTTP operations will handle most of operational concerns via software in front of booster-http. You can setup a simple NGINX proxy using the [example provided](serving-files-with-booster-http.md#protecting-booster-http-with-nginx) in [serving-files-with-booster-http.md](serving-files-with-booster-http.md "mention")

### Making HTTP Retrieval Discoverable

To enable public discovery of the Boost HTTP server, SPs should set the domain root in boostd's `config.toml`. Under the `[DealMaking]` section, set `HTTPRetrievalMultiaddr` to the public domain root in multi-address format.

Example `config.toml` section:

```
[DealMaking]
  HTTPRetrievalMultiaddr = "/dns/foo.com/tcp/443/https"
```

Clients can determine if an SP offers HTTP retrieval by running:

```
boost provider retrieval-transports <miner id>
```

Clients can check the HTTP URL scheme version and supported queries

```
// Supported queries
curl https://foo.com/index

// Version
curl https://foo.com/info
```

Clients can download a piece using the domain root configured by the SP:

```
# Download a piece by its CID
curl https://foo.com/piece/bagaSomePieceCID -o download.piece
```
