# Bitswap Retrieval

`booster-bitswap` is a binary that runs alongside the `boostd` process, to serve retrievals over the Bitswap protocol. This experimental feature of boost provides a number of tools for managing a production grade Bitswap retrieval service for a Storage Provider's content.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is currently no payment method in booster-bitswap. This endpoint is intended to serve free content.
{% endhint %}

## Why enable retrievals via bitswap?  
Bitswap retrieval introduces interoperability between IPFS and Filecoin, as it enables clients to retrieve Filecoin data over IPFS. This expands the reach of the Filecoin network considerably, increasing the value proposition for users to store data on the Filecoin network. This benefits the whole community, including SPs. Users will be able to access data directly via IPFS, as well as benefit from retrieval markets (e.g. Saturn) and compute over data projects (e.g. Bacalhau).

## `Booster-bitswap` modes
There are two primary "modes" for exposing `booster-bitswap` to the internet.

1. In `private mode` the `booster-bitswap` peer ID is not publicly accessible to the internet. Instead, public Bitswap traffic goes to `boostd` itself, which then acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding that traffic on to `booster-bitswap`. This is similar to the way one might configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for an otherwise private web server. `private mode` is simpler to setup but may produce greater load on `boostd` as a protocol proxy.
2. In `public mode` the public internet firewall must be configured to forward traffic directly to the `booster-bitswap` instance. `boostd` is configured to announce the public address of `booster-bitswap` to the network indexer (the network indexer is the service that clients can query to discover where to retrieve content). This mode offers greater flexibility and performance. You can even setup `booster-bitswap` to run over a separate internet connection from `boostd`. However, it might require additional configuration and changes to your overall network infrastructure.

### Demo configuration

You can configure booster-bitswap in the demo mode and familiarise yourself with the configuration. Once you are confident and familiar with the options, please go ahead and configure `booster-bitswap` for [production use](bitswap-retrieval.md#setup-booster-bitswap-to-serve-retrievals-publicly).

1\. Clone the `release/booster-bitswap` branch from the boost repo

```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost.git
cd boost
git checkout release/1.5.1-rc3
```

2\. Build the `booster-bitswap` binary:

```
make booster-bitswap
```

3\. Initialize `booster-bitswap`:

```
booster-bitswap init
```

4\. Record the peer ID output by `booster-bitswap init` -- we will need this peer id later

5\. Collect the boost API Info

```
export ENV_BOOST_API_INFO=`boostd auth api-info --perm=admin`

export BOOST_API_INFO=`echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'`
```

6\. Run booster-bitswap

```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO
```

7\. By default, booster-bitswap runs on port 8888. You can use `--port` to override this behaviour

8\. Fetching over bitswap by running

```
booster-bitswap fetch /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8888/p2p/{peerID} {rootCID} outfile.car
```

Where `peerID` is the peer id recorded when you ran `booster-bitswap init` and `rootCID` is the CID of a data CID known to be stored on your SP.

## Setup `booster-bitswap` To Serve Retrievals

As described above, `booster-bitswap` can be configured to serve the retrievals in 2 modes. We recommend using `public mode` to avoid greater load on `boostd` as a protocol proxy.

### Private Mode

1\. Clone the `release/booster-bitswap` branch from the boost repo

```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost.git
cd boost
git checkout release/booster-bitswap
```

2\. Build the `booster-bitswap` binary:

```
make booster-bitswap
```

3\. Initialize `booster-bitswap`:

```
booster-bitswap init
```

4\. Record the peer ID output by `booster-bitswap init` -- we will need this peer id later

5\. Stop `boostd` and edit \~/.boost/config.toml to set the peer ID for bitswap

```
[DealMaking]
  BitswapPeerID ="{peer id for bosoter bitswap you recorded earlier}"
```

6\. Start `boostd` service again

7\. Collect the boost API Info

```
export ENV_BOOST_API_INFO=`boostd auth api-info --perm=admin`

export BOOST_API_INFO=`echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'`
```

8\. Run booster-bitswap

```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO --proxy={boostd multiaddress}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get a `boostd` multiaddress by running `boostd net listen` and using any of the returned addresses
{% endhint %}

9\. By default, booster-bitswap runs on port 8888. You can use `--port` to override this behaviour

10\. Try to fetch a payload CID over bitswap to verify your configuration

### Public Mode

1\. Clone the `release/booster-bitswap` branch from the boost repo

```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost.git
cd boost
git checkout release/booster-bitswap
```

2\. Build the `booster-bitswap` binary:

```
make booster-bitswap
```

3\. Initialize `booster-bitswap`:

```
booster-bitswap init
```

4\. Record the peer ID output by `booster-bitswap init` -- we will need this peer id later

5\. Stop `boostd` and edit \~/.boost/config.toml to set the peer ID for bitswap

```
[DealMaking]
 BitswapPeerID ="{peer id for bosoter bitswap you recorded earlier}"
 BitswapPublicAddresses = ["/ip4/{booster-bitswap public IP}/tcp/{booster-bitswap public port}"]
 BitswapPrivKeyFile = "{path to libp2p private key file for booster bitswap}"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The libp2p private key file for booster-bitswap can generally be found at \<booster-bitswap repo path>/libp2p.key
{% endhint %}

The reason boost needs to know the public multiaddresses and libp2p private key for `booster-bitswap` is so it can properly announce these records to the network indexer.

6\. Start `boostd` service again

7\. Collect the boost API Info

```
export ENV_BOOST_API_INFO=`boostd auth api-info --perm=admin`

export BOOST_API_INFO=`echo $ENV_BOOST_API_INFO | awk '{split($0,a,"="); print a[2]}'`
```

8\. Run booster-bitswap

```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO
```

9\. By default, booster-bitswap runs on port 8888. You can use `--port` to override this behaviour

10\. Try to fetch a payload CID over bitswap to verify your configuration

## `Booster-bitswap` configuration

`booster-bitswap` provides a number of performance and safety tools for managing a production grade bitswap server without overloading your infrastructure.

### Bitswap Server Performance

Depending on your hardware you may wish to increase or decrease the default parameters for the bitswap server internals. In the following example we are increasing the worker count for various components up to 600. This will utilize more CPU and I/O, but improve the performance of retrievals. See the command line help docs for details on each parameter. 

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO \
  --engine-blockstore-worker-count=600 \
  --engine-task-worker-count=600 \
  --max-outstanding-bytes-per-peer=33554432 \
  --target-message-size=1048576 \
  --task-worker-count=600
```
{% endcode %}

### BadBits filtering

Booster-bitswap is automatically setup to deny all requests for CIDs that are on the BadBits Denylist. The default badbits list can be override or addition badbits list can be provided to the  `booster-bitswap` instance.

#### To override the default badbits list

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO --badbits-denylists <URL>
```
{% endcode %}

#### To provide additional badbits list

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO --badbits-denylists https://badbits.dwebops.pub/denylist.json <URL1> <URL2>
```
{% endcode %}

### Request Filtering

`booster-bitswap` provides a number of controls for filtering requests and limiting resource usage. These are expressed in a JSON configuration file `<booster-bitswap repo>/retrievalconfig.json`

{% hint style="info" %}
You can create a new `retrievalconfig.json` file if one does not exists
{% endhint %}

```
{
   "AllowDenyList": { // list of peers to either deny or allow (denying all others)
   	"Type": "allowlist",  // "allowlist" or "denylist"
   		"PeerIDs": [
   			"Qma9T5YraSnpRDZqRR4krcSJabThc8nwZuJV3LercPHufi",
   			"QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N"
   		]
   },
       "UnderMaintenance": false, // when set to true, denies all requests
       "StorageProviderLimits": {
           "Bitswap": {
                       "SimultaneousRequests": 100, // bitswap block requests served at the same time across peers
                       "SimultaneousRequestsPerPeer": 10, // bitswap block requests served at the same time for a single peer
   		"MaxBandwidth": "100mb" // human readable size metric, per second
   	}
   }
}
```

To make changes to the current configuration, you need to edit the `retrievalconfig.json` file and restart `booster-bitswap` for the changes to take affect. All configs are optional and absent parameters generally default to no filtering at all for the given parameter.

You can also configure `booster-bitswap` to fetch your retrieval config from a remote HTTP API, possibly one provided by a third party configuration tool like CIDGravity. To do this, start `booster-bitswap` with the --api-filter-endpoint {url} option where URL is the HTTP URL for an API serving the above JSON format. Optionally, add --api-filter-auth {authheader}, if you need to pass a value for the HTTP Authorization header with your API

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
booster-bitswap run --api-boost=$BOOST_API_INFO --api-filter-endpoint <URL> --api-filter-auth <OPTIONAL SCURITY HEADERS>
```
{% endcode %}

When you setup with an API endpoint, `booster-bitswap` will update its local configuration from the API every five minutes, so you won't have to restart `booster-bitswap` to make a change. Please, be aware that the remote config will overwrite, rather than merge, with the local config.

### Bandwidth Limiting

Limiting bandwidth within booster-bitswap will not provide the optimal user experience. Dependent on individual setup, setting up limitations within the software could have a larger impact on the storage provider operations. Therefore, we recommend storage providers to set up their own bandwidth limitations using existing tools.

There are multiple options to setup bandwidth limitating.
1. At the ISP level - dedicated bandwidth is provided to the node running booster-bitswap.
2. At the router level - we recommend configuring the bandwidth at the router level as it provides more flexibility and can be updated as needed. To configure the bandwidth on your router, please check with your manufacturer.
3. Limit the bandwidth using different tools available in Linux. Here are some of the examples of such tools. Please feel free to use any other tools not listed here and open a Github issue to add your example to this page.

#### TC
[TC](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html) is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. There are examples available online detailing how to configure rate limiting using TC.

You can use the below commands to run a very basic configuration.
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
sudo tc qdisc add dev <network interface> root handle 1: htb
sudo tc class add dev <network interface> parent 1: classid 1:20 htb rate 100mibit
sudo tc qdisc add dev <network interface> parent 1:20 handle 20: sfq perturb 10
sudo tc filter add dev <network interface> parent 1: protocol ip prio 1 basic match 'cmp(u16 at 0 layer transport eq 8888)' flowid 1:20
```
{% endcode %}

#### Trickle
[Trickle](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/trickle) is a portable lightweight user space bandwidth shaper, that either runs in collaborative mode (together with trickled) or in standalone mode.
You can read more about rate limiting with trickle [here](https://www.tecmint.com/limit-linux-network-bandwidth-usage-with-trickle/). Here's a starting point for configuration in trickle to rate limit the booster-bitswap service.
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
``` 
[booster-bitswap]
Priority = <value>
Time-Smoothing = <value>
Length-Smoothing = <value>
```
{% endcode %}

#### Wondershaper
Another way of controlling network traffic is to limit bandwidth on individual network interface cards (NICs). [Wondershaper](https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper) is a small Bash script that uses the tc command-line utility in the background to let you regulate the amount of data flowing through a particular NIC. As you can imagine, while you can use wondershaper on a machine with a single NIC, its real advantage is on a machine with multiple NICs.
Just like trickle, wondershaper is available in the official repositories of mainstream distributions. To limit network traffic with wondershaper, specify the NIC on which you wish to restrict traffic with the download and upload speed in kilobits per second. 

For example,
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
wondershaper enp5s0 4096 1024
```
{% endcode %}
